    <!-- We use our own resolver chain that includes the resolvers from the public
         settings file so that we can tell it which revisions are "changing". That is
         can have new files without the revision number changing. For our own builds
         we use latest.integration as the rev number, but publish to it many times.

         I don't want to set "changing=true" in the ivy.xml file's dependency section
         as that forces Ivy to hit the repo every time and thus breaks offline builds.

        This one extracts all the bits we need from the forge-common artifacts, but only
        when we're retrieving artifacts for the build conf, not the bootstrap conf.

        I could not get the Ivy filtering to work correctly so all the filtering
        on when to run the task is done in the task using dependent targets.
